== Data in Block4Log

The following types of data are going to be handled within Block4Log:

=== Load carrier exchange events
- Data format: EPCIS
- Double-signed by both exchange parties
- Specification: link:epcisMessageSpecification.md[EPCIS Message Specification]
- Message examples: link:epcisMessageExamples[EPCIS Message Examples]
** Note: only Option1_XML_URN.xml is currently GS1 standard compliant
** JSON/JSON-LD is still WIP in EPCIS/CBV 2.0
** Also, the EPCIS/CBV 2.0 working group considers to allow GS1 Digital Link URIs in addition to EPC URNs.
* Example: instead of "urn:epc:idpat:grai:4000001.11111.\*", 
the equivalent GS1 DL URI would look as follows: "https://id.gs1.org/8003/04000001111114".
* The latter had the OPTION to enter resolvable links into GS1's Resolver Service.
* For instance, these links could point to master data of a given party, location, or asset.

=== Vouchers
- Debtor
- Amount/Type/Quality of Pallets
- Holder ( = owner) of debt note
- History of double signed transactions => All former holders
** Including transaction dates
** Including Creation
** Including voucher resolution (EOL) if applicable

=== Master data

==== Parties
- GS1 Key: PGLN (Global Location Number for Parties)
- Master data attributes:
*** Party name
*** Headquarters address
** Street address one
** City 
** Postal code 
** Country code (ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code)

==== Locations
- GS1 Key: SGLN (Global Location Number for Physical Locations, without extension)
- Master data attributes:
*** Location name
*** Address of physical location
** Street address one
** City 
** Postal code 
** Country code (ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code)

==== Load Carriers
- GS1 Key: GRAI (Global Returnable Asset Identifier, without serial number part)
- Master data attributes:
*** Load carrier name
*** ??? Name of owning party (open pools)/manufacturer (open pools)
*** ??? Specification/Standard (ideally: Web Reference)
*** ??? Image
*** ??? Dimensions (length/width/depth)
*** ??? tbd

==== Voucher
- GS1 Key: GDTI (Global Document Type Identifier, without serial number part)
- Master data attributes:
*** Document name (String, e.g. 'Load carrier voucher')
*** Valid through (Date, e.g. '2021-08-02')
*** Name of issuer
*** ??? tbd

=== Black Board/Pin Board for Public Announcements

- All such announcements are opt-in optional

- Offer / Need Pallets
*** Location
*** Amount
*** Type/ quality (GS1 IDs)
*** Until
*** Contact/Service Endpoint to accept offer/start price negotiation
*** Pricing information

- Total Pallet Balance
** "Alice owes Bob a number of X Pallets"
*** Amount
*** Type/ quality (GS1 IDs)
** Publishing this kind of information does reveal that 
*** there is a trade relation
*** rough idea of trade volume (if people know some math ;) )
** Enables "Ring Exchange"
*** If A owes B, B owes C and C owes A, some amount of dept can just be cancelled without sending any payments.


== Data Visibility Constraints

* All voucher data might be business relevant (revealing trade relations/volumes) 
** Full read access control by signing parties required

* Debt Notes
** Visibility constraints to be discussed
** Initial Holder/Holder history might be sensitive?

* Company IDS
** Public anyway
** Master data might be discussed

* Public Announcements
** Well... public ;)


== Zero-Knowledge Notarization

[[ZKN_General]]
=== General Idea

The following technical concept, as developed independently by SAP/EECC/others,
can be applied to notarize data without giving up full fine grained access
control, hence data ownership. In this sense, the proof of data integrity is
"zero-knowledge", i.e. integrity of the data is secured without revealing any of
the data itself.

In <<EPCIS_Example>>, a simple shipping event with source and destination is shown. Events in Block4Log will have quantities instead of individual EPCs in the "What?" dimension, but this is a minor point.

.Quantity Element for asset classes without serial IDs
[source,xml]
<extension>
    <quantityList>
        <quantityElement>
            <epcClass>urn:epc:class:lgtin:4054739.099914.20160711</epcClass>
            <quantity>600</quantity>
        </quantityElement>
    </quantityList>
</extension>

New EPCIS 2.0 JSON/JSON-LD structure (WIP!)
"quantityList": [
    {
        "epcClass": "urn:epc:idpat:grai:4000001.11111.\*",
        "quantity": 60
    }
]


[[EPCIS_Example]]
.EPCIS Event Example

<<EPCIS_Hash>> shows how a hash tree is constructed by first hashing all
individual Fields and then concatenating the hashes and hashing again to get to
the next level. Here, a flat tree with only one layer below the root is used for
simplicity. Very large data objects are more efficiently hashed into deeper
trees.

[[EPCIS_Hash]]
.(Flat) Hash Tree
image::EPCIS-hash-tree.png[EPCIS Event Example]

When the data owner, say Alice, chooses to reveal some data to Bob, say, she can
reveal the hashes of the values that should be kept secret together with the
clear text she wants to reveal, see <<EPCIS_Sharing>>. Bob can then hash the clear text, concatenate
with the revealed hashes and check that hashing the concatenation yields the
root hash. This way, he can verify that the revealed data is the same that
entered the original root hash. If the root hash is obtained from a trusted
Notary, in our case from a Block Chain, Bob can trust in the data from Alice not
being changed after notarization.

[[EPCIS_Sharing]]
.Selectively revealing (yellow) only some fields and intermediate hashes(yellow) is a zero-knowledge proof of the data integrity of the revealed values

=== EPCIS Sanitization

GS1 Germany currently develops an updated concept for an EPCIS Discovery Service. A fundamental idea is that some part of the data in an EPCIS event which is not sensitive can be published as a "sanitized event". Some values in the sanitized event are hashed following the idea of section <<ZKN_General>>. The algorithm that is exemplified in <<Sanitization>> is similar to the idea shown in <<EPCIS_Sharing>> but for the set of fields that are excluded, hidden or public being fixed.

[[Sanitization]]
.A sanitized event is a header type data structure which only contains non-sensitive information needed to verify a chain of custody. Some of the fields are hashed. A hash of the full event is included.
image::sanitization.png[EPCIS Event Example]

Since the sanitized event contains a hash of the full event, it is sufficient to
publish the root hash of the sanitized event in order to enable full
verification. This concept is a little more complicated and less powerful than
the general idea outlined in section <<ZKN_General>> above, but it follows GS1 standard and provides clear guidance on what to include/hide in publishing partial EPCIS information.


=== EPCIS Discovery Service

An (EPCIS) repository (might be distributed) that contains only sanitized events
together with information about service endpoints/protocols to ask for the
hidden data is called a discovery service. For the use case of tracking the
chain of custody of a serialized item, this is very useful. In Block4Log, it needs to be evaluated whether the sanitized events as such add any value.



== Conclusions for Block4Log

=== Notarization

By using Zero-Knowledge Notarization, the resulting root hash can be published
anywhere, in particular on a public block chain such as BitCoin or Ethereum, without revealing any data.
This way, the advantage of a public chain, i.e.

- Extremely low risk of loosing data / integrity
- Public availability independently from Block4Log
- No need to run the Block Chain Infrastructure

can be leveraged.


=== Confidential Data Exchange

In order to actually exchange data confidentially upon authorized request, we
still need a Block4Log internal "peer to peer layer". This function can be
provided by existing technology such as Corda, Hyperledger, etc. but also by
direct connections between the existing systems such as EPCIS repositories, ERP,
etc. which however need to be discovered/routed/connected through the Block4Log
Platform.


=== (Consortium) Public Information

To publish data within the Consortium in a public blackboard like fashion, we
may use existing block chain technology (Hyperledger, etc.) or also simpler
methods such as EPCIS repositories + discovery, MQTT or other Message brokers,
etc.

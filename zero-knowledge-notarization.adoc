[[ZKN_General]]
== General Idea

The following technical concept, as developed independently by SAP/EECC/others,
can be applied to notarize data without giving up full fine grained access
control, hence data ownership. In this sense, the proof of data integrity is
"zero-knowledge", i.e. integrity of the data is secured without revealing any of
the data itself.

In <<EPCIS_Example>>, a simple shipping event with source and destination is shown. Events in Block4Log will have quantities instead of individual EPCs in the "What?" dimension, but this is a minor point.

<<EPCIS_Hash>> shows how a hash tree is constructed by first hashing all
individual Fields and then concatenating the hashes and hashing again to get to
the next level. Here, a flat tree with only one layer below the root is used for
simplicity. Very large data objects are more efficiently hashed into deeper
trees.

.(Flat) Hash Tree

When the data owner, say Alice, chooses to reveal some data to Bob, say, she can
reveal the hashes of the values that should be kept secret together with the
clear text she wants to reveal, see <<EPCIS_Sharing>>. Bob can then hash the clear text, concatenate
with the revealed hashes and check that hashing the concatenation yields the
root hash. This way, he can verify that the revealed data is the same that
entered the original root hash. If the root hash is obtained from a trusted
Notary, in our case from a Block Chain, Bob can trust in the data from Alice not
being changed after notarization.

== EPCIS Sanitization

GS1 Germany currently develops an updated concept for an EPCIS Discovery Service. A fundamental idea is that some part of the data in an EPCIS event which is not sensitive can be published as a "sanitized event". Some values in the sanitized event are hashed following the idea of section <<ZKN_General>>. The algorithm that is exemplified in <<Sanitization>> is similar to the idea shown in <<EPCIS_Sharing>> but for the set of fields that are excluded, hidden or public being fixed.

[[Sanitization]]
.A sanitized event is a header type data structure which only contains non-sensitive information needed to verify a chain of custody. Some of the fields are hashed. A hash of the full event is included.

Since the sanitized event contains a hash of the full event, it is sufficient to
publish the root hash of the sanitized event in order to enable full
verification. This concept is a little more complicated and less powerful than
the general idea outlined in section <<ZKN_General>> above, but it follows GS1 standard and provides clear guidance on what to include/hide in publishing partial EPCIS information.


=== EPCIS Discovery Service

An (EPCIS) repository (might be distributed) that contains only sanitized events
together with information about service endpoints/protocols to ask for the
hidden data is called a discovery service. For the use case of tracking the
chain of custody of a serialized item, this is very useful. In Block4Log, it needs to be evaluated whether the sanitized events as such add any value.
